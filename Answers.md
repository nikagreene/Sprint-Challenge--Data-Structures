1. What are the order of insertions/removals for the following data structures?
   - **Stack**

   The order of insertions/removals for stacks is LIFO or last-in-first-out. The items near/closest to the base are the items that have been there the longest. Items are added and removed from the top. 

   - **Queue**

   The order of insertions/removals for stacks is FIFO or first-in-first-out.
   The items near/closest to the front are the items that have been there the longest. Items are added at the end of the queue, while removal takes place at the front.

2. What is the retreival time complexity for the following data structures?
   - **Linked List**

   For accessing and searching a linked list, the time complexity is O(n). Which Means it is linear and in proportion to the size of the data set. For inserting and deleting time complexity is O(1). Which means it is constant time and will always execute at the same time regardless of the size of data. 

   - **Hash Table**

    In most cases, Hash Tables time complexity is O(1). 

   - **Binary Search Trees**

    For searching, accesssing, inserting and deleting, the time complexity for Binary Search Tree is O(log n). 

3. What are some advantages to using a Hash Tables over an array in JavaScript?

    The time complexity for a hash table is faster than that of an array.
